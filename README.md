# homeawayfromhome
### Purpose: Since all of the developers on our team are from very different cultures, we decided to design an app that allows every individual to feel close to home even when theyâ€™re miles and miles away. In order to do that, we wanted to provide a solution to finding a new area to live in, based on the things that each individual user finds most important. We provide detailed information about neighborhoods (including but not limited to: average rent, walk scores, home listings, etc.) Our hope is to give every individual the opportunity to access important information that is necessary to consider when making a new move. We are currently based in the Bay Area (more specifically Berkeley), but we plan to expand across neighborhoods throughout the country in future versions. We have made Home Away from Home a totally free website --- users can get information without logging in or registering an account.
